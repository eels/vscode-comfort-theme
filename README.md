## Installation

This theme is available on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eels.vscode-comfort-theme):

2. Enter **Install Extensions** in the search bar
3. Search for **Comfort Theme** in the extensions list
4. Locate and select the theme, then press install

If it doesn't do so automatically, to apply the theme press `ctrl(⌘) + k`, then `ctrl(⌘) + t` and choose **Comfort**, or one of its variants, from the theme selector.

## Contributing

I recently moved over from Atom to Visual Studio Code and during the process couldn't find a theme that felt like home.

There's a heap of VSC sections that I've never seen and a whole lot more programming languages that I don't use. If you find yourself using **Comfort** and would like to help out by making some improvements or fixing any bugs then feel free to submit a PR for discussion!

1. Fork this repository and clone your own version
2. Create a new branch for any changes
3. Install the required dev dependencies (`yarn install`)
4. Open the **comfort** directory in Visual Studio Code
5. Examine any theme changes in an Extension Development Host (`ctrl(⌘) + shift + d` then `Launch Theme`)
6. Run the dev command to watch for changes and auto rebuild the themes
7. Commit and push your changes
8. Submit a PR for review and discussion :tada:
